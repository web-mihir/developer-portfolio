         <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work.
            That's
            why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.

               efficient.
               I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even
               know
               the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

               They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed
               it
               to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
